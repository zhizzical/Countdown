# Countdown Timer ðŸ•’
This isn't your typicall countdown. Enter your seconds, and let the drama unfold. When the timer hits zero, you'll get a little surprise instead of just silence. 
## Features
* Input Validation: Only allows valid input (positive integers). Entering negative seconds or letters results in a friendly message instead of a crash.
* Timer with Drama: After you enter your countdown time, it ticks down second by second, and when it hits zero, you get a BOOM! message.
* User-Controlled Countdown: You control the time â€” no weird automatic timers here.
* Exit Option: Just type a valid number to start, or let the timer run out. It's that simple. You can even quit the program with a message thatâ€™ll make you think twice.
  
## How to Use
* Run the Program: Start by running the program. Itâ€™ll ask you how many seconds you want to start the countdown from.
* Enter Seconds: Type in a positive number (seconds). If you enter something weird (like negative numbers or letters), the program will call you out. No worries though, itâ€™ll ask you again.
* Watch the Countdown: The timer will start counting down from your number, showing the seconds in real-time. When it reaches zero, youâ€™ll get a dramatic BOOM! message.
* Done: After the countdown ends, the program exits â€” simple as that.
